Dithering is useful during quantization to prevent correlated distortion.
Dithering adds randomness to the signal before quantization to cause light value
shifting after quantization to diminish the perceived effect of a discrete step
in amplitude. As a result the noise floor for a quantized signal becomes
consistent rather than forming patterns.

Pulse code modulation encodes signal with their binary representation.
